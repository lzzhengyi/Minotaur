# Minotaur
An Androidhelper script designed to run on Android phones. Can be compiled into an apk using Buildozer.

Based off Hunt the Wumpus, that classic game from 30 years ago.

To run this, I HIGHLY recommend first downloading the QPython3 app, using it to open the minotaur.py file, and then running it.
